## Comments

- What is the impact of such an algorithm (antiAffinity) over the cluster hosting capacity ? Why ?

This algorithm implies that there will be more hosts turned on because of the need of fault-tolerance, also we can assume that there will be less capacity because a lot of the cluster will be used for replicas.
